    <h1>Icelandic Ice Hockey</h1>
    <header>
        <p> Iceland – One could easily assume that a country named Iceland is predestined to be a hotspot for a sport often called ice hockey, but that’s not exactly the case, yet...
            Although the island is larger than Ireland or Sicily, it is inhabited by little more than 300,000 people.</p>
            <p>Iceland’s ice hockey age began in the ‘50s in the northern town of Akureyri. Locals played on frozen ponds and rivers, but due to the unpredictable weather it wasn’t that easy to organize hockey in Akureyri and even less so in the more populated South. The winters aren’t as freezing as in other parts of the same latitude such as Alaska or Siberia thanks to the Gulf Stream, but is more temperate, like in Central Europe.</p>

        <p>Money plays no role in the league. “We’re all amateur players,” says Thorhallur Vidarsson, who works in a bar downtown Reykjavik, plays for Skautafelag Reykjavikur, and has also represented Iceland internationally. “We all have regular work or study. And we have to pay for our own equipment and the bus rides to road games.”</p>
